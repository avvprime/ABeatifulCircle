A Beautiful Circle is a 2D game tried to be written with Javascript and Canvas API with the use of Offscreencanvas and Web Workers for the One Button Game Jam.

Unfortunately deadline is getting closer and I am not even close to finish the game. I spent most of my time learning how to work with workers, offscreencanvas and how to structure
all of these while trying to build a stateful and modular game.

So I need to pivot, game engine. I will continue to build my game with another game engine but I didn't want to fade out my 2 day work just like that.

In the future I may complete this project but for now it will stay here for my "previous work examples portfolio".

This is the general algorithm thought for structure.
